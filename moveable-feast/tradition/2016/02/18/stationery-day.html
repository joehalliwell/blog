<h1 id="stationery-day">Stationery Day</h1>

<p>After the success of last year’s Tradition Inventing Day, it’s time again to devise a fixture for my calendar.</p>

<p>Celebrate Stationery Day by covering your desk in squares of yellow paper. Each square of yellow paper must be inscribed with the rune TAX.</p>

<p>Celebrate Stationery Day by buying a notebook that you’ll never fill. Stationery is the cenotaph for our literary ambitions.</p>

<p>Celebrate Stationery Day by asking your friends, “What’s mightier than the sword?” Your friends must then shout, “THE PEN IS,” or perform a forfeit.</p>

<p>Stationery Day falls on the Friday after Easter.</p>
