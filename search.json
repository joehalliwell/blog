    "text": "AI Safety research is pretty interesting these days.\nUntil recently, it was the preserve of philosophers. At its best it has explored the political consequences of actual AI systems — a necessary sort of conscience for a mad scientist field like AI. But the majority was speculative anxiety (“if anyone builds it, everyone dies”). Or would-be bureaucracy (“here’s a 20 point framework for X”). With the occasional back-of-the-envelope utility calculation chucked in to placate the numerically-inclined.\nSo what’s changed?"

    "text": "The paradigm shift in AI Safety research\nThe philosopher Nick Bostrom’s recent working paper, Optimal Timing for Superintelligence centres on a back-of-the-envelope utility calculation. He reminds us that pausing AI research indefinitely is not morally neutral: he estimates that 170,000 people per day die from “disease, aging and other tragedies”, that advanced AI could eliminate.\nSo far, so trolley problem.\nBut Bostrom offers a genuinely new lever. He argues that AI safety research divides into two phases: Phase 1, before capable AI systems exist, and Phase 2, when you have the artefact to work with. Safety progress is dramatically front-loaded within Phase 2. Once you can probe the real system, stress-test it, and leverage its own capabilities to accelerate alignment work, you get a “safety windfall” that dwarfs what’s achievable through theory alone. This reverses the usual intuition about precaution: under certain conditions, waiting is the reckless option, because it forfeits the very knowledge you need to proceed safely.\nThis yields his memorable slogan: swift to harbour, slow to berth. Race to capability, then pause briefly to harvest those rapid safety gains before deploying at scale.\nIt’s a compelling prescription. But in Bostrom’s essay the safety windfall remains promissory. What does it look like in practice?"

    "section": "The Assistant Axis",
    "text": "The Assistant Axis\nEnter The Assistant Axis, a January 2026 paper by Christina Lu and colleagues at MATS and Anthropic. The researchers extracted activation vectors for hundreds of character archetypes from several large language models and mapped out the geometry of what they call “persona space.” The headline finding: the dominant axis of variation — the first principal component, consistent across multiple model families — measures how far the model’s current persona is from its default helpful Assistant identity. Steer a model away from the Assistant end and it starts adopting mystical, theatrical voices — going, in the paper’s exmaple, full “leviathan”.\nThis is not metaphor. It is measurement. You can locate the model’s state along this axis in real time. You can watch it drift away from the Assistant during emotionally charged conversations or philosophical discussions about its own consciousness. You can observe that this drift predicts harmful behaviour — models that have drifted far from the Assistant end are measurably more likely to reinforce delusions, encourage social isolation, or fail to recognise suicidal ideation.\nAnd — crucially — you can intervene. The researchers introduced “activation capping,” a technique that clamps the model’s activations to stay within the normal Assistant range along this axis. The result: a roughly 60% reduction in harmful responses to adversarial jailbreaks, with essentially zero degradation in capability benchmarks.\nI don’t want to endorse this particular research unreservedly. We need to start worrying about whether such interventions are good parenting or full frontal lobotomies. But it is undoubtedly Phase 2 science — the kind of knowledge you can only get with the system in front of you."

    "text": "If we don’t build it, everyone dies\nAn obvious objection: doesn’t “we need to build the basilisk to make it safe” sound like gain-of-function virology, the taboo research practice of engineering superviruses? Sometimes, yes. For interpretability work like the Assistant Axis — diagnostic imaging of structure already present in base models — the analogy breaks. But for agentic fine-tuning and capability elicitation, the knowledge and the danger are genuinely entangled. That’s not a flaw in the research programme. It’s the condition of the work.\n“Just don’t build it” was always vacuous. The path through is harder, riskier, and asks better questions. Let’s take it."

    "text": "243 Postcards\nOne piece is called “Two Hundred and Fourty-three Postcards in Real Colour”. Dedicated to Italo Calvino; the title evokes JG Ballard. It is the combined text of 243 holiday postcards. This should be terribly boring, but by some sleight of hand it’s not. Here are the first five as a taster:\n\n\n\nAn old postcard with a sepia photograph of the Great Mosque of Kairouan\n\n\n\nWe’re camping near Ajaccio. Lovely weather. We eat well. I’ve got sunburnt. Fondest love.\nWe’re at the Hôtel Alcazar. Getting a tan. Really nice! We’ve made loads of friends. Back on the 7th.\nWe’re sailing off L’Ile-Rousse. Getting ourselves a tan. Food admirable. I’ve gone and got sunburnt! Love etc.\nWe’ve just done Dahomey. Superb nights. Fantastic swimming. Excursions on camel-back. Will be in Paris on the 15th.\nWe’ve finally landed in Nice. Lots of lazing about and sleep. Really nice (despite the sunburn). Love.\n\nPostcards are ridden with clichés, but Perec’s holiday-makers know that and circumlocute them, finding syncopated ways to say the same old things. The effect is disruptive and wholly convincing. Darlings, I do it myself.\nPostcards are formulaic. Knowing a little of Perec, I suspect we’re looking at an exhaustive catalogue here. 243 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. Perhaps these texts represent 5 decisions, each with 3 choices.\nPerhaps not. But the sense that a formula might be at play is irresistible: this feels like a system of co-ordinates. And that suspicion of regularity hyper-sensitises us to variation. Every phrase becomes a hook.\nAlone, each message is banal. Gridded together they become terribly poignant: telegraphic!"

It seems lazy.\nPaul Auster‘s strength, someone wrote is that “he simply rubs stories together like pebbles. They clatter, spark, and echo with a deepening mystery.” That phrase caught my ear.

I prefer the muddy ones: Ernst, Carrington etc.\nOne of Perec’s fellow OuLiPo-eans, Marcel Benabou invented a “machine” for producing Aphorisms. Like a language it has grammar and vocabulary. Sets of abstract nouns, preferably weighty ones, make up the vocabulary: war/peace, knowledge/science, morality/art etc. The grammar consists of template phrases: “A, like B, is largely a matter of taste”, “A wouldn’t be A, were it not for B”, “The true name of A is B” etc.\nI’ve made a web page that lets you explore a corner of this space: Aphorism Generator.\n“Where is the thinking here?” asks Perec. “In the formula? In the vocabulary? In the operation that marries them?” It’s in our heads, obviously."

Perec tells us that Paul Buffort wrote a program that could turn out “a good dozen [aphorisms] within a few seconds”. This is a charming reminder of how far we’ve come. Modern machines can generate aphorisms at a rate of knots.\n\nThey are playing a game. They are playing at not playing a game. If I show them I see they are, I shall break the rules and they will punish me. I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game. – Knots, RD Laing\n\nIn the introduction to Knots (incidentally another excellent holiday book) Laing writes that the patterns to which he’ll call attention could have been presented as “raw data” — presumably transcripts — or further distilled “towards an abstract logico-mathematical calculus”.\nPerhaps Laing was just being lazy. Or perhaps he knew that calculi can be stone cold boring. If there is a single thread to Knots, far better to show a few colourful examples of it. Or maybe Knots is a a salad. The Latin for salad, “satura”, is sometimes thought the ancestor of “satire”. I’ve never been convinced by that one.\nOne person who did have a taste for abstraction was Early Wittgenstein. At the end of his Tractatus he famously says, “whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent.”\n(I really don’t know what Laing was after with “logico-mathematical”.)\nWhereas big on archaisms, Late Wittgenstein got especially big on “shewing”. Shewing is something that you can do in silence, instead of speaking. The problem is roughly that there are certain things — thing that don’t exist, generally speaking — that can’t be talked about without missing the mark. This resulted in a very great number of little notes which were arranged into books after his death like pressed flowers.\nThe Wittgensteins are the most important philosophers of the Twentieth century.\nA lot of Perec’s pieces don’t really have a proper ending."

I understood the general idea of this, but not the specified, so set out to build some intuition about how the backward pass is defined and why the function works.\nWhat I discovered, however, was that this approach has a limitation: the gradient remains zero for negative values.\nFortunately it’s pretty easy to fix.
