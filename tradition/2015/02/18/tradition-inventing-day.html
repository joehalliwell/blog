<h1 id="tradition-inventing-day">Tradition Inventing Day</h1>

<p>Feeling slightly cheated by missing Shrove (AKA Pancake) Tuesday for the fourth or fifth year in a row, Iâ€™ve decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>

<p>Each year on the 18th of February I will invent a new festival day . The appointed date will take its rightful place in the calendar and be celebrated in the appointed way from that moment until the end of time.</p>

<p>Please join me in celebrating today, Tradition Inventing Day.</p>
