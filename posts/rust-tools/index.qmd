Many of the UNIX command line tools we use day-to-day date back to the earliest
incarnations of UNIX at AT&T in 1970s. Of course, these days we're mostly
using GNU versions[^gnu], published under free software licenses and sporting
various useful extensions.

However these don't represent much of an evolution of the ancient tools, but
rather a respectful effort to conserve them.

[^gnu]: There are many UNIXes that don't use GNU tools, but... eh... I don't use
them.

In the last decade, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a modern systems
programming language has begun to displace[^why-rust] that other UNIX stalwart,
the C programming language. It's maybe not surprising then, that there are many
excellent Rust alternatives to the hoary old GNU tools.

[^why-rust]: Why? Rust has a radical new approach to memory safety that promises to
avoid large classes of vulnerability, first class support for threading,
zero-cost abstractions for high performance, and built-in support for package
management, formatting and unit-testing.

In my
[`.bash_aliases`](https://github.com/joehalliwell/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_aliases),
`exa` has now replaced `ls`, and `cat` has yielded to `bat`. Below, you'll find
six Rust-based command line tools that are now part of my every day carry.

## Exa: ls with flair

[`exa`](https://the.exa.website/) is more or less a drop-in replacement for `ls`
with sensible defaults like human-readable file sizes and colour-coding for
different file types.

It has first-class support for creation/modification/access times and extended
filesystem attributes. When integrated with git, `exa` even indicates the
version control status of each file.

Also, if you're using a nerd font it has icons. Everyone loves that.

<!--
exa --header --group --created --modified --accessed --git --icons --extended --all --long --grid --classify --color-scale
-->

## Bat: colourful cat

`cat` is one of the oldest Unix utilities, dating back to Version 1 Unix. Yes, I
nearly always have an editor open, yes `less` is more suited to long files, and
yet I routinely find myself using `cat` to peek at files.

[`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a drop-in replacement that behaves
like `cat` in scripts, but adds user-friendly paging, syntax highlighting, git
integration and line numbers when outputting to a terminal. Much better.

## Starship: fast and fancy prompt

Did you ever install some giant shell config framework just to get a cute
prompt?

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is a cross-platform prompt, that takes its
aesthetic cues and customizability from
[Zsh's Spaceship prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)
but eclipses it in raw speed. There's never that clunky pause as hundreds of
lines of script are executed just to generate your prompt.

Starship's support for customization is inevitably somewhat limited. But its
config is simple and declarative and eliminates the need for tweaking complex
scripts and baroque environment variables.

The default setup looks great -- but I've added
[extra nerdfont bling](https://github.com/joehalliwell/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/starship.toml).

## Dust: du but useful

If you're using `du` you're almost certaininly trying to figure out why you've
run out of disk space. So you're already annoyed, and it's about to get worse.

`du` will give you raw data on file sizes to work with but you're going to have
to muck around with advanced flags and probably do some scripting to get your
answer.

In contrast [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) presents information in a
visually intuitive tree structure, making it easy to see which files or
directories are taking up space. It's also faster.

![Dust making it abundantly clear that Steam is to blame for that `npm install` failure](dust.png)

<!--
## Ripgrep: lightning fast grep

Ripgrep, or `rg` on the CLI, serves as a modern evolution of `grep` that's
faster and more ergonomic. While 'grep' might fumble through irrelevant files or
get tripped up by complex regular expressions, 'ripgrep' employs smart filtering
and respects your .gitignore settings. Thus, you get not just a list of matches
but a curated selection that is more likely to be pertinent to your project. It
enhances this further by displaying matching strings along with their file paths
and line numbers, giving immediate context to each find.
-->

## Fd: find but usable

`find` is notorious for its arcane syntax and sluggishness on large filesystems.
[`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a fast and user-friendly alternative
whose simple syntax and smart defaults priortize common use cases without losing
flexibility. And again it's damn fast.

## Cargo: install and update rust tools

If you're interested in trying the above tools, it's easy to
[get started with Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

The standard installer will give you a full set of dev tools including `cargo`,
which is Rust's package manager and swiss army knife.

Cargo can be used to install all of the programs above: a simple 'cargo
install $tool' fetches, compiles, and places them on your path.

[`cargo-update`](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update) is a `cargo`
extension that detects outdated packages and updates them in one go. This keeps
your toolset not just functional, but cutting-edge.

## Closing thoughts

The Rust CLI tool ecosystem is flourishing. In this post, I covered some tools
that I use every day, but there are tons of great Rust command line apps that I
use less frequently[^sharpeyes]. You might also want to check out:

- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom): cute, cross-platform
  system monitor
- [broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot): TUI filesystem navigator with
  sophisticated preview capabilities
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just): project-specific command runner
  &emdash; like `make` but without the baggage
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/Canop/broot): fast content search with an
  intuitive interface
- [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei): fast alternative to `sloccount`
  for counting lines of code


[^sharpeyes]: You can see some of these in the `cargo install-update`
shot above
