I’ve been reading Species of Spaces and Other Pieces a collection of
[Georges Perec's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Perec) writing this week. It’s a
perfect holiday book. It’s full of things to read and things to do. It’s a
grown-up version of the summer annuals (Whizzer & Chips) I used to read in the
car on the way to Pwllheli.

## 243 Postcards

One piece is called “Two Hundred and Fourty-three Postcards in Real Colour”.
Dedicated to Italo Calvino; the title evokes JG Ballard. It is the combined text
of 243 holiday postcards. This should be terribly boring, but by some sleight of
hand it’s not. Here are the first five as a taster:

- We’re camping near Ajaccio. Lovely weather. We eat well. I’ve got sunburnt. Fondest love.
- We’re at the Hôtel Alcazar. Getting a tan. Really nice! We’ve made loads of friends. Back on the 7th.
- We’re sailing off L’Ile-Rousse. Getting ourselves a tan. Food admirable. I’ve gone and got sunburnt! Love etc.
- We’ve just done Dahomey. Superb nights. Fantastic swimming. Excursions on camel-back. Will be in Paris on the 15th.
- We’ve finally landed in Nice. Lots of lazing about and sleep. Really nice (despite the sunburn). Love.

Postcards are ridden with clichés, but Perec’s holiday-makers know that and
circumlocute them, finding syncopated ways to say the same old things. The
effect is disruptive and wholly convincing. Darlings, I do it myself.

Postcards are formulaic. Knowing a little of Perec, I suspect we’re looking at
an exhaustive catalogue here. 243 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. Perhaps these texts
represent 5 decisions, each with 3 choices.

Perhaps not. But the sense that a formula might be at play is irresistible: this
feels like a system of co-ordinates. And that suspicion of regularity
hyper-sensitises us to variation. Every phrase becomes a hook.

Alone, each message is banal. Gridded together they become terribly poignant: telegraphic!

## Collage

Combinatorics crop up again in the essay (of sorts) “Think/Classify”. It’s a
collage piece: a handful of elegant paragraphs with little in common. Sure
they’re about thinking. But what isn’t?

Collage is a gentle, therapeutic art form. I’ve always been suspicious of it.

Things — any things, even several copies of the same thing — go together. The
choice can be arbitrary at least in so far as we’re capable of that. Things
agree with one another and contradict one another to the same degree. It seems
lazy.

Paul Auster‘s strength, someone wrote is that “he simply rubs stories together
like pebbles. They clatter, spark, and echo with a deepening mystery.” That
phrase caught my ear. There’s profundity in setting things up together and
(thereby) calling attention to the arrangement.

## Aphorism

I am suspicious of surrealism. Dali and Magritte are too slick. I prefer the
muddy ones: Ernst, Carrington etc.

One of Perec’s fellow OuLiPo-eans, Marcel Benabou invented a “machine” for
producing Aphorisms. Like a language it has grammar and vocabulary. Sets of
abstract nouns, preferably weighty ones, make up the vocabulary: war/peace,
knowledge/science, morality/art etc. The grammar consists of template phrases:
“A, like B, is largely a matter of taste”, “A wouldn’t be A, were it not for B”,
“The true name of A is B” etc.

I’ve made a web page that lets you explore a corner of this space:
[Aphorism Generator](http://www.joehalliwell.com/aphorisms.html).

“Where is the thinking here?” asks Perec. “In the formula? In the vocabulary? In
the operation that marries them?” It’s in our heads, obviously.

## Peregrination

It shouldn’t be a surprise that I’m not the first to make a
computer simulate Benabou’s machine. Computers are combiners par excellence.
Perec tells us that Paul Buffort wrote a program that could turn out “a good
dozen [aphorisms] within a few seconds”. This is a charming reminder of how far
we’ve come. Modern machines can generate aphorisms at a rate of knots.

> They are playing a game. They are playing at
> not playing a game. If I show them I see they are, I
> shall break the rules and they will punish me.
> I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game.
> -- Knots, RD Laing

In the introduction to Knots (incidentally another excellent holiday book) Laing
writes that the patterns to which he’ll call attention could have been presented
as “raw data” — presumably transcripts — or further distilled “towards an
abstract logico-mathematical calculus”.

Perhaps Laing was just being lazy. Or perhaps he knew that calculi can be stone
cold boring. If there is a single thread to Knots, far better to show a few
colourful examples of it. Or maybe Knots is a a salad. The Latin for salad,
“satura”, is sometimes thought the ancestor of “satire”. I’ve never been
convinced by that one.

One person who did have a taste for abstraction was Early Wittgenstein. At the
end of his Tractatus he famously says, “whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must
be silent.”

(I really don’t know what Laing was after with “logico-mathematical”.)

Whereas big on archaisms, Late Wittgenstein got especially big on “shewing”.
Shewing is something that you can do in silence, instead of speaking. The
problem is roughly that there are certain things — thing that don’t exist,
generally speaking — that can’t be talked about without missing the mark. This
resulted in a very great number of little notes which were arranged into books
after his death like pressed flowers.

The Wittgensteins are the most important philosophers of the Twentieth century.

A lot of Perec’s pieces don’t really have a proper ending.
