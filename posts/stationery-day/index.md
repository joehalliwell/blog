After the success of last year’s Tradition Inventing Day, it’s time again to
devise a fixture for my calendar.

Celebrate Stationery Day by covering your desk in squares of yellow paper. Each
square of yellow paper must be inscribed with the rune TAX.

Celebrate Stationery Day by buying a notebook that you’ll never fill. Stationery
is the cenotaph for our literary ambitions.

Celebrate Stationery Day by asking your friends, “What’s mightier than the
sword?” Your friends must then shout, “THE PEN IS,” or perform a forfeit.

Stationery Day falls on the Friday after Easter.
