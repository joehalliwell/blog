Feeling slightly cheated by missing Shrove (AKA Pancake) Tuesday for the fourth
or fifth year in a row, Iâ€™ve decided to take matters into my own hands.

Each year on the 18th of February I will invent a new festival day . The
appointed date will take its rightful place in the calendar and be celebrated in
the appointed way from that moment until the end of time.

Please join me in celebrating today, Tradition Inventing Day.
